### **1. Project Overview**

**Objective:**

- To develop a web application that enables customers to scan QR/Bar codes on products, add them to a virtual cart, and pay online, thereby eliminating the need to stand in long checkout queues. The app also provides optimized navigation routes through large malls and offers personalized recommendations for sponsored stores.

**Target Audience:**

- Shoppers in large malls who seek a more efficient and enjoyable shopping experience, including tech-savvy individuals, families, and those with limited time.

**Core Problem Statement:**

- Shoppers often face long checkout lines, especially during peak hours, and can struggle to navigate large malls efficiently. This results in a frustrating shopping experience and lost opportunities for stores to engage customers.
